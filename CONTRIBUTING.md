# Contributing to Falco

You are here to help on Falco? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Falco itself.

## Improving the docs

The Falco docs are stored in the `docs/` folder in this very repository. The actual documentation is written in [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) in individual files in the `docs/docs/` subfolder. You can edit individual files right inside the GitHub editor, which does not require any local setup.

To edit a piece of documentation, you can click on the “Edit this page” link in the docs you would like to update:

## Internationalization

Falco uses [`react-intl`](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) under the hood to manage internationalization. It detects the language of the user’s browser and serves that locale if available, otherwise defaults to English.
If you spot a mistake in one of the translations available, or would like to translate Falco to your language, please edit (or create) the appropriate JSON file in `frontend/translations` and submit a pull request.

## Local development on Falco

This section will guide you through installing Falco on your development machine, so that you can work on your feature or bug fix locally before submitting a PR.

### First installation

**Prerequisites**:

- `node >=12.14` — It should work fine on older versions, however it was not tested recently. You can use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage node versions on your machine.
- `docker` ([installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/)).

**Install steps**:

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:theodo/falco.git
  ```
- Move to the `falco` directory:
  ```bash
  cd falco
  ```
- Install the backend and the frontend:
  ```bash
  make install
  ```
- Start the backend:
  ```bash
  make backend/start
  ```
- Populate the database with fixtures:
  ```bash
  make fixtures/load
  ```
- Edit the .env file: replace the initial SECRET_KEY with a random string

### To (re)start the app

- Start the backend:
  ```bash
  make backend/start
  ```
- Start the frontend:

  ```bash
  make frontend/start
  ```

The project should now be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can access to the Django administration interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).

To access both these interfaces, you can login using the following credentials:

- username: `admin`
- password: `admin`

### To reset the database to its original state (with fixtures)

- Ensure that nothing is connected to your database (Django shell, Postgres GUI…)
- Run `docker-compose exec backend ./manage.py reset_db`
- Run `make fixtures/load`

### Add a new pip package to Falco’s backend

To add a Django package in Falco’s backend:

- Start the backend:

  ```sh
  make backend/start
  ```

- Once the backend is up and running, install your package inside the docker container (this may take a few minutes):

  ```sh
  docker exec -it falco_backend_1 pipenv install <package_name>==<package_version>
  ```

  _This will install your package, then update Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files accordingly._

- Once package is installed, stop backend using `Ctrl + C`

- To make your package installation persistent, you have to rebuild all Django containers (this may also take a few minutes):

  ```sh
  docker-compose build --no-cache backend

  docker-compose build --no-cache celery
  ```

- Relaunch backend and ensure you have no error:
  ```sh
  make backend/start
  ```
- Enjoy! 🎉
